# RunescapeTradingProject
One of my favourite video games of all time is the massively popular MMORPG, [Runescape]http://www.runescape.com/). It's an adventure game where you can control a character to do many different things in a virtual world. One of the things that makes Runescape so unique is the fact that it has a whole virtual currency which players use to purchase items in the game. Much like the economy in real life, prices of items in the game are determined by supply and demand. There is a place in the game known as the Grand Exchange, where players can look at prices of items and put in items for sale/buy items. Much like the trading floor in real life, the grand exchange is a hotspot of economical activity in game, as it is where the majority of the wealth in the game changes hands. In this project, my goal is quantitatively build a financial model of the Runescape economy, and autonomously trade/sell items in the game with the intention to generate a large amount of in-game currency.
